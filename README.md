# Core Domain Charts

Core Domain Charts help you to visualise the strategic importance of each sub-domain or business capability in your software architecture allowing you to make business model-aligned architectural decisions.

[Core Domains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBRluTD5oHo) are the parts of your domain where the expected [ROI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp) is greatest, and deserve the highest focus.

The true power of this technique is the conversations that it triggers, especially cross-discipline. Complexity is something that engineers can gauge whereas business differentiation is provided by product managers or business stakeholders.

## How to Use
There are a variety of ways the Core Domain Chart can be used, but it's important not to try to and visualise all of the possible information in a single diagram. Below are multiple versions showing different types of information to choose from.

### Sub-domain/Bounded Context Portfolio
This is the simplest flavour. Simply plot each of your sub-domains or bounded contexts on the chart to get a relative sense of ordering between them.

### Context Map With Team Topologies
You can augment your Core Domain Charts with the dependencies between your bounded contexts and the type of [Team Topologies](https://github.com/TeamTopologies) Interaction Mode in play.

### Architecture Migration
With a slight tweak of the y axis label, core domain charts can be used to plan the order in which you migrate from your current architecture to your target architecture.
